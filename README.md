## About
Ever since I started working out at the gym, I've been keeping a detailed record of nearly every workout I have done (which includes exercises, weights and reps). It's been really useful helping me see what I've done and then going higher. Such a large dataset has also been great for viewing my progression. Reading all this data was great but I wanted a way to visualise it which is exactly what this project solves. With plenty of flexibility, it allows you to plot exercises, weights, reps, decide how it is presented and view it on easy to understand charts


## Features
- View your data in an interactive chart
- Save charts as PNGs for future reference
- Select exercise of choice from all recorded exercises
- Plot best sets for each workout (Simple View) or every single performed set (Detailed View)
- Display sets as weight done or reps performed
- Choose which weights to ignore (useful for omitting warm ups)


## Usage
Make sure to install Python3 first before proceeding

- Install Plotly
```
pip install plotly
```

- Start the program by running the strong_app_data_visualizer.py script with Python
```
python .\strong_app_data_visualizer.py
```
